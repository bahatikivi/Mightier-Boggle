     * -- At every Position on the grid:
     * ---- add the Position of that point to a list of stored positions
     * ---- if your list of stored positions is >= 4, add the corresponding word to the allWords Map
     * ---- recursively search for valid, adjacent grid Positions to add to your list of stored positions.
     * ---- Note that a valid Position to add to your list will be one that is either horizontal, diagonal, or
     *      vertically touching the current Position
     * ---- Note also that a valid Position to add to your list will be one that, in conjunction with those
     *      Positions that precede it, form a legal PREFIX to a word in the Dictionary (this is important!)
     * ---- Use the "isPrefix" method in the Dictionary class to help you out here!!
     * ---- Positions that already exist in your list of stored positions will also be invalid.
     * ---- You'll be finished when you have checked EVERY possible list of Positions on the board, to see
     *      if they can be used to form a valid word in the dictionary.
     * ---- Food for thought: If there are N Positions on the grid, how many possible lists of positions
     *      might we need to evaluate?
